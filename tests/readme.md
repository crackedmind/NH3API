TODO:
Here will be the compatibility tests for the library. We will check for:
1) Undefined behaviour caused by the implementation issues(fix them!)
2) Compiler-specific behaviour leading to diverging runtime behaviour(make the library as compiler agnostic as possible!)
3) Binary compatibility 
And so on.
